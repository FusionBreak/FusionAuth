# FusionAuth

FusionAuth is a lightweight and simple library for .Net projects. It provides functions to handle authorization requests on a per-privilege or per-property basis.

Due to the simplicity, the use is recommended only in small projects without high security requirements. (As it is the case in my private projects!)
